"""
Implement a neural field using a simple MLP.

The MLP maps from `in_features`-dimensional points (e.g., 2D xy positions) 
to `out_features`-dimensional points (e.g., 1D color values). To make your
implementation more general, also let the user specify any activation function.

Some conventions we use that you will need to follow IF you want to use the unit tests:
1. The last layer is always linear.
2. All layers have bias IFF self.bias is True.
3. There is one linear+activation function layer from the input (`in_features`) to `hidden_features` and then `hidden_layers-1` 
    linear+activation function layers from `hidden_features` to `hidden_features`, and then a linear layer from `hidden_features`
    to `out_features`.

        Implement a forward pass where the output AND the input require gradients so as to be differentiable.

        Return: tuple of (outputs, gradient-enabled coords). Shape of outputs should be (N, out_features).

        Hint: coords should be (N, d) where N is the number of points (batch size) and d is the dimensionality
        if your input/field. Copy them and enable gradients on the copy. Then, pass them into your network
